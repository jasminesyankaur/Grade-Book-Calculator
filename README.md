# Grade-Book-Calculator
This program takes in a grades.txt file which holds a list of students first and last names along with 3 grade averages. The program takes all the names and averages stores them in an array and computes the mean, median, minimum and maximum.  Then outputs the results. This program was created before we were taught about classes and vectors so the program uses malloc, arrays and structs.

In order to compile use g++ *.cpp on CSCE machines
In order to execute use ./a.out
